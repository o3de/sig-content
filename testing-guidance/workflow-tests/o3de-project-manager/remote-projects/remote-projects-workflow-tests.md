# Remote Projects

These workflows center around testing the basic functionality of the Project Manager remote project acquisition tools.

## Prerequisites

* Locally installed tools for the remote source being used (git installed with credentials for GitHub, for example)
* A GitHub repository that has a compatible remote project (older projects may need to be updated to support this feature).
   * Examples:
     * NewspaperDeliveryGame (https://github.com/o3de/NewspaperDeliveryGame.git)
     * Another [O3DE](https://github.com/o3de) owned sample with a compatible remote project.
   * Your own repository URI with a project you've created.

## Common Issues

*   Project does not download successfully
*   Project doesn't build automatically, if that option is selected
